* WCGoals DataDash

Using goal data from the Fifa World Cup 2018 in Russia. I have created a data dash-board using D3.js, DC.js and Crossfilter. The site has been created with Python using the Flask web framework, and has been deployed using Heroku.

** Why use?
One of the nice aspects of this data dash-board is the way you can view the types of goal scored depending on the minute of play (seperated into 10 minute intervals). As not many players score more then 1-2 goals at a World Cup, whilst including a top 5 goal scorers row-chart, I have mainly restricted the view of data to a country and continental basis.
